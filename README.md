Documentation
------------------------------------------------

NaPDI-KG is a knowledge graph framework to identify and generate mechanistic hypotheses for pharmacokinetic natural product-drug interactions (NPDIs). This repository has been forked from the [Knowledge-Graph-Hub](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub). NaPDI-KG uses the [PheKnowLator ecosystem](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator) to create the ontology-grounded KG and the KG-Hub ecosystem to integrate the nodes and edges extracted from natural product-related biomedical literature. NaPDI-KG includes the following components -

1. Biomedical Ontologies

2. Ontology Extensions for Natural Products

3. Biomedical Literature

4. Linked Open Data

Notes about PheKnowLator workflow
------------------------------------------------

This repository only contains the reference Jupyter notebooks used to run the [PheKnowLator](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator) workflow. For complete details on semantic integration of OBO ontologies and biomedical data sources in NaPDI-KG as well as latest versions of Jupyter notebooks run as part of the PheKnowLator workflow, refer to this [fork of the PheKnowLator repository](https://github.com/sanyabt/PheKnowLator/tree/pheknowlator-sbt).
